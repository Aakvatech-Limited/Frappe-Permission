# Permissions Processing Code Features

- Process permissions: The code defines a function `process_permissions` that is called when a document is saved or deleted. This function is responsible for managing the permissions associated with the document.

- Field metadata: The code uses the `meta` property of the document to retrieve the fields of type `Table MultiSelect` with the options set to `Permission Detail`. This metadata is used to retrieve the existing permissions associated with the document.

- Permissions map: The code creates a map of existing permissions associated with the document using the `permissions_map` dictionary. This map is used to create new permission records if they do not exist.

- Get existing permissions: The code retrieves existing permission records associated with the document using the `frappe.get_all` function.

- Create new permission records: The code creates new permission records using the `add_permission_record` function. This function takes in several parameters such as the reference doctype, reference docname, row id, doctype name, and docname.

- Delete permission records: The code deletes permission records associated with the document using the `frappe.delete_doc` function.

- Ignore permissions: The code uses the `ignore_permissions=True` parameter while creating and deleting permission records. This parameter allows the code to bypass permission checks while performing these operations.
